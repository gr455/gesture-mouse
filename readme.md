# gesture-mouse
This python project uses opencv and pynput to move the mouse cursor(and click) on the screen completely gesture controlled.
The mouse can be moved by moving the fist clenched. Opening the fist will result in a left click.
Can be used to skip YouTube ads without reaching for the mouse ;)

Further used machine learning in OpenCV to train a HAAR Cascade Classifier for detection.

Make sure the cascade classifiers (the two xml files) are in the same directory as the .py file. Otherwise make necessary changes to the code.
